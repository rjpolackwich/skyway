# skyway
Skyway is a small, lightweight python library that can be used to access OpenStreetMap data via the Overpass service. It is intended to be used in the automation of satellite imagery data labeling, but is also a standalone API for any kind of Overpass access. This project is under heavy development.


This library currently depends on the canvas library, which is private. Install the canvas library locally on your system, and then clone this library, cd to it, and run `python setup.py install` and you should be able to start working with the API.
